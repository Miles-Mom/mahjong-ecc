Unless otherwise noted, these files are from http://www.martinpersson.org. Attribution is required, however merely a link will suffice, and no other conditions are added.

- joker.png was created by me, through image editing of a picture of a physical mahjong tile, onto the martinpersson background. 

In the future, we should probably change our tile set to one that is public domain and does not require attribution. The unicode mahjong characters may be a good source of such images. Note that vector images should probably be converted to raster for when they are displayed on the site due to file size.
