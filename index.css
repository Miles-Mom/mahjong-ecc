	While viewport relative units work fine on desktop, some mobile browsers will not show the entire viewport, due to the url bar.
	See https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2015/02/18/viewport-height-is-taller-than-the-visible-part-of-the-document-in-some-mobile-browsers/

	To counteract this, we will use a CSS variable that will be dynamically changed by JavaScript.
	In order to convert vh to use the relative variable, use the following two find and replace regexp. (note: make sure that every single declaration ends in a semicolon)

	Find and replace (-)?([\d.]+)vh with calc(var(--vh) * $1$2)
